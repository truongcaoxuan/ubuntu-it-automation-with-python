Welcome to your first lab on fixing problems in Python. 
In this lab, you'll first have to fix an incorrect Python script. 
This includes:
*Fixing the file permissions to make it executable.
*Fixing a bug in the code.

After that, you'll write your own Python module and use it from the original script.
